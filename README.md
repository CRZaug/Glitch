# Glitch

A small project created for GWC summer immersion program 2020 to allow students to explore flexbox. It's meant to be paired with this super awesome CSS/flexbox [resource](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). Students can easily remix the Glitch code and look through the properties for parent and child elements, trying out different combinations to see what everything does.
